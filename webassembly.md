### What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly is low-level code that runs in modern browsers. It can run alongside JavaScript and can work together with it and also share WebAssembly modules. WebAssembly is not intended to be written by hand, rather to be used as a compilation target for other languages.

> See: [Mozilla - What is WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts#what_is_webassembly)

### WebAssembly vs. JavaScript

WebAssembly is not a replacement for JavaScript. WebAssembly is intended for tasks that require native performance. WebAssembly must be compiled, whereas JavaScript does not have a compilation step. JavaScript has a huge ecosystem of frameworks and libraries.

#### Use cases for WebAssembly

WebAssembly has [WebAssembly - High-level goals](https://webassembly.org/docs/high-level-goals/) that define what WebAssembly aims to achieve. From these, we can also derive the use cases.

The listed use cases are not a complete list, rather the use cases that would be most relevant for me. To see the full list, view the link below.

> See: [WebAssembly - Use cases](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/)

##### Inside the browser

- Better execution of cross-compiled languages
- Image/video edition
- Games
- Peer-to-peer applications
- Music application
- Image recognition
- Live video augmentation(e.g. AR filters)
- VR & AR
- CAD apps
- Platform simulation/emulation
- Remote desktop
- VPN

##### Outside the browser

- Server-side application
- Hybrid native apps on mobile

### Key concepts

> See: [Mozilla - WebAssembly key concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts#webassembly_key_concepts)

- **Module**: A module is a compiled WebAssembly binary. It declares imports and exports like ES modules and is stateless.
- **Memory**: Memory is an ArrayBuffer that is accessed by WebAssembly memory access instructions.
- **Table**: A typed array containing references(e.g. functions).
- **Instance**: A module paired with the runtime state(memory, table and variables).

WebAssembly modules, memories, tables and instance can be created with JavaScript. Exports of WebAssembly instances can be called by JavaScript as functions.
