## Adding a possibility to continue without an account in an online shop

Many online shops require you to create an account first, before you can make an order. This might be desired by the company trying to sell their goods, however, it is a big hurdle during the process of ordering something online. It is therefore a better practice to provide the possibility to check out as a guest and once you finished your order, we can provide the option to create an account.
