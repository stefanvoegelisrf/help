## [Blender](blender)

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation.

## [Physically based rendering](physicallybasedrendering)

Physically based rendering (PBR) is a computer graphics approach that seeks to render images in a way that models the lights and surfaces with optics in the real world. It is often referred to as "Physically Based Lighting" or "Physically Based Shading".

## 3D Model from photographies

Create a 3D model from a series of photos using **Adobe Substance 3D sampler** and **Blender**.

- Take a series of pictures from different angles and different distances. Take more than 50
  - Ideal lighting condition is cloudy day light.
- Import the data set into Adobe Substance 3D sampler and let it analyze it and create the model.
- Save the model to a project.
- Export the model inside the project.
- Open Blender and create a new scene.
- Import the .USD file into the scene and position it correctly.
- Export the scene as a glb
- The model can now be viewed by using [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/)

## 3D scene/model viewer

Google provides a web component called [Web Viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) which can easily be integrated into websites to display 3D models. It is very easy to use with `.glb` files.
