## Focal length/FOV

The Focal Length controls the amount of zoom, i.e. the amount of the scene which is visible all at once. Longer focal lengths result in a smaller FOV (more zoom), while short focal lengths allow you to see more of the scene at once (larger FOV, less zoom).

## Depth of field

Focus an object to determine the focal point. If no object is focussed, define the focal distance.

## Sensor size

TODO

## Orthographic perspective

Objects appear at their actual size, regardless of distance. Lines will be parallel.

## Camera view

Camera view shows the current scene from the active camera's viewpoint.
