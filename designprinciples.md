# Design principles

**Design principles define fundamental guidelines for designing digital experiences. They help in creating better design decisions.**

## Mobile first

Develop products with mobile handsets in mind. Interactive elements are designed with a focus on being used on a touch display. Usage with mouse is also respected, but never with drawbacks for touch usage.

## Context

Respect the users perspective and take their context into consideration. Explain, what is not self-explanatory. Inform about the state of our systems and confirm user interactions with feedback.

## Easy implementation

Design that is easy to implement and does not block progress is essential to support development. 

## Consistency

With consistent design, help our users to find a home . Present them with common and consistent interaction patterns. 

## Natural language

Approach our users directly and search for active wording. Invite the user to a dialogue and donâ€™t appear distanced. Use short but precise wording. 

## Accessibility as a standard

In order to design for everyone, accessibility is a standard.

## Adaptive design

Adaptive layout react to input from users, devices and screen elements.
